# GitKraken : Zero to Hero

Here are my notes on the Workshop [GitKraken : Zero to Hero](https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/).

## GitHub Pages

The web-page is published using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

1. Create an initial `index.md` and add text to it (in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org)).
2. Commit and push your changes to your repository.
3. Visit your pages GitHub repository and go to `Settings`.
4. Under `Pages` select the branch where `index.md` has been created and its location (by default these are `main` and
`root`).
5. Save these changes.

You should then have a green box appear with the message "_Your site is published at..._" with a URL pointing to its
location.

You can update the theme of the site using the `Theme Chooser` on the same page. As you can see I've opted for the
`Hacker` theme.
